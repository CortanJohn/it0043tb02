    <h1>ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>

    <h2>No Classes on Jun 12,2024</h2>

    <p>
        We are happy to let you know that on <span class = "June ">June 12, 2024</span>, in
        commemoration of Labor Day, there won't be
        any
        classes.
        This momentous day honors the innumerable efforts and sacrifices made by laborers throughout. It
        acts as a
        reminder of the value of equitable treatment, labor rights, and the continuous pursuit of social
        justice in
        our
        community. While we take a moment to appreciate the toil and devotion of laborers everywhere, we
        also
        utilize
        this occasion to recognize the critical role that they play in forming our economies and
        communities.
    </p>
    <p>While classes will be suspended for the day, we encourage students to take advantage of this time to
        reflect
        on
        the significance of Labor Day and its impact on our collective history. Whether you choose to spend
        the day
        relaxing with loved ones, engaging in community events, or pursuing personal interests, we hope you
        find
        meaning
        and fulfillment in this brief respite. Additionally, we extend our gratitude to all members of the
        workforce,
        past and present, whose efforts continue to shape the world we live in. Let us use this day to honor
        their
        legacy and renew our commitment to upholding the principles of dignity, fairness, and equality for
        all
        workers.
    </p>
    <p>On behalf of the faculty and staff, we wish you a restful and enjoyable Labor Day. May this time of
        reflection
        and appreciation inspire you to pursue your academic goals with renewed vigor and dedication upon
        your
        return.
        Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to welcoming you back to campus soon.

    </p>
