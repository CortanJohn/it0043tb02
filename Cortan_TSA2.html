            <p>
                We are happy to let you know that on <font color="red"><strong> June 12, 2024</strong></font>, in
                commemoration of Labor Day, there won't be
                any
                classes.
                This momentous day honors the innumerable efforts and sacrifices made by laborers throughout. It
                acts as a
                reminder of the value of equitable treatment, labor rights, and the continuous pursuit of social
                justice in
                our
                community. While we take a moment to appreciate the toil and devotion of laborers everywhere, we
                also
                utilize
                this occasion to recognize the critical role that they play in forming our economies and
                communities.
            </p>
            <p>While classes will be suspended for the day, we encourage students to take advantage of this time to
                reflect
                on
                the significance of Labor Day and its impact on our collective history. Whether you choose to spend
                the day
                relaxing with loved ones, engaging in community events, or pursuing personal interests, we hope you
                find
                meaning
                and fulfillment in this brief respite. Additionally, we extend our gratitude to all members of the
                workforce,
                past and present, whose efforts continue to shape the world we live in. Let us use this day to honor
                their
                legacy and renew our commitment to upholding the principles of dignity, fairness, and equality for
                all
                workers.
            </p>
            <p>On behalf of the faculty and staff, we wish you a restful and enjoyable Labor Day. May this time of
                reflection
                and appreciation inspire you to pursue your academic goals with renewed vigor and dedication upon
                your
                return.
                Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to welcoming you back to campus soon.
